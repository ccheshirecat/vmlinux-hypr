# linux-hypr-guest-config-generator.sh
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Generate a kernel .config specifically tailored for a high-performance
#   "HYPR" virtual machine guest. This configuration ensures that all
#   critical drivers for booting, networking, and performance are built
#   directly into the kernel (`=y`), avoiding reliance on initramfs for
#   essential modules.
#
# STRATEGY:
#   1. Start with a minimal `defconfig` baseline.
#   2. Use `allmodconfig` to discover and enable all possible features as modules.
#   3. Forcibly override critical drivers and features to be BUILT-IN (`=y`).
#      This includes VirtIO, SCSI, SMP, and custom HYPR options.
#   4. Run `make olddefconfig` to resolve dependencies and create the final config.
#
# USAGE:
#   1) Place this script in the root of your kernel source directory.
#   2) Make it executable:
#      chmod +x linux-hypr-guest-config-generator.sh
#   3) Run the script:
#      ./linux-hypr-guest-config-generator.sh
#   4) Build the kernel:
#      make -j$(nproc)
#   5) Install the kernel:
#      sudo make modules_install && sudo make install
